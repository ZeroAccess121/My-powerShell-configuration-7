## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this profile, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **PowerShell 7+:** While some features may work on older versions, PowerShell 7 (or later) is highly recommended for full compatibility and performance.
      * [Install PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
  * **Oh My Posh:** Essential for the customizable prompt.
    ```powershell
    winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget
    # or if you use Scoop:
    scoop install https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/oh-my-posh.json
    ```
  * **Nerd Font:** Crucial for displaying the icons and glyphs used by Oh My Posh themes correctly. After installing, set it as your font in your terminal application (e.g., Windows Terminal).
      * [Download Nerd Fonts](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nerdfonts.com/downloads)
  * **fzf (Fuzzy Finder):** Highly recommended for interactive menus like `git-menu` and `theme`.
    ```powershell
    winget install fzf
    ```

### Optional Modules (Recommended)

The profile will attempt to load these if they are installed, providing additional functionality:

  * **Terminal-Icons:** Displays file and folder icons.
    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
  * **PSFzf:** Integrates `fzf` with PSReadLine for powerful history search.
    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name PSFzf -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
  * **posh-git:** Provides Git status information for your prompt.
    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

### Installation Steps

1.  **Locate your PowerShell Profile:**
    Open PowerShell and type `$PROFILE` and press Enter. This will output the full path to your current PowerShell profile file (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`).
      * If the file doesn't exist, you can create it:
        ```powershell
        if (-not (Test-Path $PROFILE)) {
            New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force
        }
        ```
2.  **Edit your Profile File:**
    Open the profile file in your preferred text editor (e.g., `notepad $PROFILE`, `code $PROFILE`).
3.  **Copy the Script Content:**
    Copy the entire content of the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` script from this repository and paste it into your profile file.
4.  **Save and Restart:**
    Save the changes to your profile file and then close and reopen your PowerShell terminal. Your new configuration should now be active\!
